webform_download v0.1
                 v0.2 Multiple webforms

A very simple, webform download link.

I built this module to provide a link to non-administrators the ability to download
webform submissions without user confusion. Just click the link. Easy-Peazy.

TODO:
<ol>
<strike><li>Currently this only works for one webform. Need to provide links to multiple webforms.</strike>
<li>Currently downloads ALL the submitted data. Should provide the option to download only the latest.
</ol>
