webform_download v0.1

A very simple, webform download link.

I built this module to provide a link to non-administrators the ability to download
webform submissions without user confusion. Just click the link. Easy-Peazy.

TODO:
<strike>1. Currently this only works for one webform. Need to provide links to multiple webforms.</strike>
2. Currently downloads ALL the submitted data. Should provide the option to download only the latest.

I have started working on the second one, and per chance you will not see this message as I have
already fixed it, but just in case....there it is.
